**Lecture**

Today we will be chatting about (link: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API text: HTML5 API’s) to get data from sensors like GPS, accelerometers, etc. Unfortunately not all browsers and devices allow access to these features, checkout (link: caniuse.com text: caniuse.com) to check to see if what you want to use works for the device/browser you want to use it on. We will also briefly talk about scripting API’s like (link: https://jqueryui.com/ text: jQuery UI) and (link: https://modernizr.com/ text: Modernizr). And we will be covering how to best optimize your website to work on mobile and tablet devices.

Examples:
Geolocation – HTTP and HTTPS (Now only works for HTTPS)
Local Storage
Video Input – HTTP and HTTPS (Now only works for HTTPS)
Audio Input- HTTP and HTTPS (Now only works for HTTPS)
Gyroscope / Accelerometer
Virtual Reality
jQuery UI
Mobile Template

Experiment with HTML5 APIs and Scripting APIs like jQuery UI.

**Homework**

Finalize you final project idea and design static layouts for your website or mobile web app. Also write out a game plan for how you will be programming it and what (if any) third party API’s, JavaScript frameworks or HTML5 API elements you will be using.
