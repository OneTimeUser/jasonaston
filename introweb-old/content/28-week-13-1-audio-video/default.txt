Todays class was how to simply place **self-hosted** audio and video on your website using the HTML5 `<video>` and `<audio>` elements- not video from youtube or vimeo...those we can EMBED pretty easily.

We used Handbrake to handle converting movies (.mov, etc.) into HTML5 compatible .mp4 format as most major browsers support this format. There are other fallbacks that we should consider in practice and production. There is an extended tutorial (link: https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/video/basics/ text: HERE) that will walk you through options and styling. 

Let's continue with a quick list of what to do in Handbrake:
-Open Handbrake
-click "Open Source" - find your file
-Default settings are fine. If you want to resize your video clip, take a look at the presets on the right hand side and choose one that suits what you are trying to do. Remember the same applies to videos as images. So perhaps its best to render out several versions and swap them out according to browser/device.
-check Peak Framerate (variable frame rate)
-check web Optimized
-then click "Add to Queue"
-Navigate to "Queue", select the file and click "Start"

At this point you should have an mp4 file rendered out. Now, lets see how we integrate it into our code:
Basic method for the video element:
```
<video controls>
              <source src="cheers.mp4" type="video/mp4">
              <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a <a href="cheers.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
</video>
```
All parameters of `<video>` go inside of the opening tag. We then define the `<source>` like so. Then follow up with a fallback just in case the browser cannot play the video.

Their are other features you can include.  `Controls` is one of them (and is probably wise, otherwise you can leave it out and the video has none). Check the following example:
```
<video controls width="400" height="400"
       autoplay loop muted
       poster="poster.png">
  <source src="rabbit320.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="rabbit320.webm" type="video/webm">
  <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a <a href="rabbit320.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
</video>
```
-`width` and `height`- constrains the video to the box but doesn't change its aspect ratio. 
-`autoplay` plays the video upon page load
-`loop` loops the video
-`muted` does not play sound
-`poster` provides an image (jpg, gif, png) that shows on the video prior to the video being played.

We used Audacity to handle our music and sound recording and converting to mp3, a widely used and accepted type for HTML5.

-Open up Audacity. A screen similar to the above will appear.
-Make sure that you have a microphone installed. You can use the built-in microphone on your laptop if need be, but a USB powered external microphone will really help to make your audio come out crisp and clear.
-Click on the record button (#1) and begin speaking. A waveform will begin to appear (#2) as your voice is detected by the microphone.
-Click on the stop button (#3) in order to stop the recording.
-Click the rewind button (#4) and play button (#5) to listen to your recording.
-To trim your recording make sure that the selection tool is clicked (#6) then highlight the portion of the audio that you would like to cut. Click on Edit > Cut to extract the selected area.
-To record a second clip, click the record button (#2) – a second waveform will appear beneath the first.
-To reposition a clip, click on the slider tool (#7) and slide the desired clip back and forth.
-Using the volume adjustment tool (#8) you can increase or decrease the volume of a specific clip.
-You can import other audio files (WAV, MP3) by clicking on Project > Import Audio. The audio file will appear as a new waveform. 
-You can also apply special effects to your audio clips. This can be accomplished by selecting a portion of a clip using the selection tool (#6) and then using the Effect menu.
-When you are finished working on your clip you should save your project by clicking on File > Save.
-You can export your project as an MP3 file by clicking on File > Save Other > Export as MP3. Note that Audacity does not come pre-loaded with MP3 export capabilities. You can add this feature into the system by installing the free LAME MP3 Conversion Library. When you navigate to the download page for LAME, download the ZIP file and unzip it someplace safe on your computer.  Then return to Audacity and direct it to where that file is.

Now that you have an mp3 file, we implement audio much the same way we do video.
```
<audio controls>
  <source src="test.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
  <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 audio. Here is a <a href="test.mp3">link to the audio</a> instead.</p>
</audio>
```
The features we have available are:
`autoplay`
`loop`
`controls` 
`muted`

You can also style the default width of the audio player by targeting the `<audio>` tag in css:
```
audio{
   width:600px;
}
```
