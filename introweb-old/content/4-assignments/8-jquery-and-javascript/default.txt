**jQuery and Javascript**

In this assignment you will use jQuery and Javascript to add interactivity to your website.

**Instructions**
Make revisions and improvements to the site as necessary—you know more about making websites now. Using the JavaScript library, jQuery, and the Javascript Date() object, add a new layer of interactivity to your website. 

The jQuery library should be included with your website files along with an **external** .js file with your jQuery code.
Wrap your script in a jQuery ready event.
Use jQuery syntax to access elements (i.e. with CSS-style selectors).
Use jQuery syntax to change element content (such as text or images).
Use jQuery syntax to change element style.
Use jQuery syntax to apply an effect to an element, i.e. hide(), show(), fadeIn(), etc.
At least one of these changes should occur in response to a user event, such as “click.”
In addition, add an interactive element that is based on any information available to you from the Date() object. This could be something like a greeting based on the time of day, a countdown to a holiday or birthday, etc. **Be creative with it and be sure to use variables and if statements.**

**Publishing Your Website**
Upload your website to the i6 Unix server in its own directory. Test your files again once they are “live” on the Web server to make sure they are accessible. Update your assignments directory to link to this page.

**Submitting Your Assignment**
Submit the following via NYU Classes. More information on submitting files with NYU Classes is also available here.

**The URL to your website on i6**
A compressed archive containing all the files of your website
