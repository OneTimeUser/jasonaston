**Lecture**
We rounded out some of our HTML knowledge today with some important elements, namely the `div` and `span` elements.  These are versatile  elements you will use often.  

We also addressed `<!DOCTYPE html>` for letting the browser know we are using HTML5. We added certain `<meta>` elements to describe our webpage more fully. 

I showed you how to use comments `<!-- comments -->` and went over two very important attributes to further locate and address certain elements: `id=""` and `class=""` as well as why we would either/or/both.  Finally we finished class with a taste of CSS, exercising some control over our fonts.

All of this comes from Chapter 8 and 12 in your book so read these chapters for more in depth knowledge.
