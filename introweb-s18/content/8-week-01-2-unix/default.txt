**Lecture**

This week we got a brief primer on and about Operating Systems and went into some basic but important UNIX commands. Peruse them (link: http://www.jason-aston.com/introweb-s18/unix text: here). 
Perhaps most confusingly but important as you get your initial pages published to your i6 server is the permissions. Permissions allow you to set different access modes to three groups: yourself the owner, a group, and the public.
