**DUE APRIL 19th**
In this assignment, you will integrate your current website into the Bootstrap framework. You may find it easier to start from scratch, copying and pasting in certain html sections where they belong. I'll talk a bit more about this in class.  

Make a new project folder where you will put all your website files for this assignment.
Follow instructions for getting started with Bootstrap. This is simply a matter of linking to the files that Bootstrap depends on or downloading the files and linking to them in your folder. (link: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/ text: This is the link to "Getting Started"). Do not use any other method of besides this one. It will only complicate your life for now. 

Follow the instructions in the above Bootstrap page. In addition, under the "Bootstrap Styles" section in the head of your HTML, create a new link to a stylesheet of your own, which is custom.css or whatever you want to name it. This will be your own custom CSS file in addition to the Bootstrap CSS file that you are linking to.
Now create that custom CSS file.

Now, go ahead a download (link: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases/download/v4.0.0/bootstrap-4.0.0-dist.zip text: Bootstrap Source Files) or go to the downloads page (link: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/download/ text: here) to download the compiled js and css files. Most of this you will not use unless you want to take a look at the nuts and bolts that comprise Bootstrap. But you will want to keep the non-minimized CSS files handy so that customize the default theme according to your needs (SEE BELOW).

**Leveraging Bootstrap’s Features**
Familiarize yourself with the various aspects of working with Bootstrap, including the following.

The built-in CSS classes that can be used to create custom layouts, including grid-based layouts with responsive layouts features
The built-in CSS classes that can be used to style common user interface components, such as buttons, glyphs, drop-down menus, and thumbnail images
The built-in CSS classes that can be used to create interactive widgets, such as carousels, tabs, and drop-down menus

**Customizing the Default Theme**
You can quickly and easily change the default style of components and interactive widgets by following the customization workflow outlined on the Bootstrap site.

For each element you want to customize, find its code in the compiled Bootstrap CSS
Copy the component's selector and styles and paste them in your custom stylesheet. 
For instance, to customize the navbar background, just copy the .navbar style specification in the CSS and paste it in your custom stylesheet. Then edit the CSS you just copied from the Bootstrap source.
Continue this process until you’re happy with your customizations.

**Requirements**
Here is a list of required elements to include.

Create at least 3 pages of content with a consistent style
Create the general page layout on each page using Bootstrap’s responsive grid layout features
Use a single Bootstrap navigation component on all pages to allow visitors to browse among the 3 (or more) pages
Use Bootstrap’s carousel widget, including at least three images
Incorporate at least one Bootstrap component (such as buttons, glyphs, drop-down menus, etc.) on each page of the site
Beyond these requirements, feel free to explore Bootstrap and take this project as far as you would like! Sites that demonstrate extra effort and thoughtfulness will be considered for extra credit. In particular, try to customize your website so that it does not look like Bootstrap’s default themes.

**Publishing Your Website**
Upload your website to the i6 Unix server in its own directory. Test your files again once they are “live” on the Web server to make sure they are accessible. Update your assignments directory to link to this page.

**Submitting Your Assignment**
Submit the following via NYU Classes. More information on submitting files with NYU Classes is also available here.

The URL to your website on i6
A compressed archive containing all the files of your website
