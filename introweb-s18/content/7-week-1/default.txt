**Lecture**

In this first class, we briefly go over elements and principles of the Internet, since that will be the medium we work with throughout the semester. 

What is the Internet? 
It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web(WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.

We also highlight the Digital Revolution which represents the shift from analog and electric to digital- digital circuits which begin to drive our machines and day-to-day life. The characteristics of digital are quite different from analog. Perhaps the most expressive difference is embodied in the signal. We know digital signals to be a combination of 1's and 0's. We go over this in greater detail as well as other characteristics.

Moore's Law primarily describes a constant rate of change in computer processor speed but also:
-The number of transistors that can be placed inexpensively on an integrated circuit doubles every two years.
-The number of transistors is closely connected to processor speed, memory, etc.
-Computer processor speed has doubled approximately every two years.
-Mooreâ€™s Law seems to be plateauing but has held steady for the past 40 years.
