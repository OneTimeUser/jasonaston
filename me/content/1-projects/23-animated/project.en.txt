Title: Animated

Text: 

I've worked on many many animations so there are too many to list here. But these are four of my favorite animated series/pilots that I have had the pleasure of contributing art direction and animation while being part of an insanely talented animation collective. Try and watch all the way through, they are truly worth it.

This was a pilot made by David Arquette which featured a star studded cast in a hybrid animation/live action series. Ultimately it was too expensive to make, but we had a great time making it. My main duties were animation producing as well as animation.
