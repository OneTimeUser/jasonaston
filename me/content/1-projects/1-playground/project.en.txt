## The World is Your Canvas
(image: graffiti.gif)
Piggy backing off of my work with Ai Wei Wei and Olafur Eliasson, I wanted to explore the approximation of physical expression with its permanence and consequence manifest in the digital space. This is was a fun experiment in "ideal conditions" rendering the whole world a canvas for your thoughts and proclamations. No building is too tall, no structure unaccommodating. No one owns anything (well, ok, Google owns the topographical representation but only for now).
This proof of concept warrants further exploration beyond my abilities alone. Get in touch if this at all interests you!

## CWWWYSTALZ

Millions of people seek the consult and aegis of crystals in their day to day. They are a potent and necessary vade mecum for the spritiual, the lost, the hopeful and superstitious. But I ask if this physical totem transcends the physical into the digital. I don't have the answer to that but I do have an answer to ensuring you are covered online. And it's called CWWWYSTALZ - crystals meant to be used while you surf the web, to protect you, to hide you, to ensure your browsing habits are healthful and productive.

## Hairwall

Hairwall is a kinetic sculpture project that came out of my investigations into the various chronobiological phonomena in and on the human body. The first iteration of this project simple cemented a functioning "hair" growth mechanism within a handmade porcelain white column. The hair itself was made of soft foam tubing that could be wound tightly to conserve space, but would expand under minimal tension to look like a beautiful strand of black hair. The mechanism subtly turned every minute or so to push the hair out of the column. Many iterations later, this improved mechanism and hair were installed in Japan as part of a country wide exhibition of site specific artworks. I chose an unassuming, humble alleyway to house this project.
