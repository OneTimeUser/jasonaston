**Image Editing and Animation**
DUE: MARCH 8

**Part 1: Image**
Create a picture that has been made using layers. The image should feature a subject placed in an unlikely, unique, or impossible location OR if you have some other idea of what you want to do, let me know. There should be at least FIVE layers—including the subject—and one of these should be a text layer. Try to make the image as realistic as possible, given its imaginary nature. You might place yourself in the Arctic, climbing a national monument, walking on the moon, or standing beside a celebrity. You might place a cat inside a washing machine! Or a pencil inside a stomach?!?

Pay attention to the edges of objects, shadows, and lighting as well as to the proportions of your objects. Use a variety of tools to enhance your image—there are many available in Photoshop and you are encouraged to explore them. Have fun with this assignment and feel free to be imaginative! You might need to use masks for your image so make sure to go here  (https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/masking-layers.html)to learn how to make them.

**Part 2: Animation**
Now that you have a new image composite, create a gif animation with the layers of your project.
Include a variety of animation techniques such as animating by position and/or opacity, filters, transformations, and your own manipulated layers.
Your animation should consist of multiple keyframes with tweening/animation between them.

**Saving Your Project**
Save your original project file, layers intact, in Photoshop (PSD) format. Then, when your work is complete, export two versions of your project:

-A still-image version of your project as a JPG or PNG file
-An animated version of your project as a GIF file
You should keep (do not delete) your PSD file after you’ve exported the images.

*Pay attention to the file size of your exported images so they are web ready. The still image (JPG or PNG) should be less than 1 Mb and the animation (GIF) should be less than 5 Mb. Adjust the compression settings as necessary.


**Publishing Your Images**
Create a basic HTML page for your project and use the img element to display both versions—still and animated—on the same page. The img elements should include src, width, height, and alt attributes that correspond to the images. Publish the web page, along with your images, to the i6 server. Update the code of your assignments directory to link to this new page.

**Submitting Your Assignment**
Submit the following via NYU Classes. 

1. The URL to your new web page that displays the images on i6
2. A compressed archive containing your Photoshop project file, JPG or PNG, GIF, and HTML document
The upload may take time; wait for confirmation before closing the browser window
Please note that you are required to submit files along with the URL in order to receive credit for your work.
