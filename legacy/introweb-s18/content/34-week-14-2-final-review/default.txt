    -how can style sheets be applied (external, internal, inline)
3. Principles of Cascade
    -css styles will conflict, but which style wins out depends on some factors:
    -in order of importance:
     1. !important

           -in order of importance: 
              a. id selectors 
              b. class selectors
              c. element selectors
     3. location (in style sheet, for example conflicting or the same styles within a style sheet will be governed by whichever is lower in the sheet).

1. File Formats
    -JPG, GIF, PNG, SVG: when would you use each 

__________

Design and Wireframing:
-understand the principles behind design and wireframing. Think about why it is such an important step in web development and process.
-I expect you to be able to pick out the most logical site map and wireframing mockups for a given scenario. I'll give you a situation (agency/client relationship and target market) and present you with options.

Responsive Web Design:
-Why do we prioritize it?
-Know how to write media queries and know about what they are doing when you look at them (are they overwriting previous media queries, are they mobile first, etc.). Essentially know how to interpret them.
-Know about how we treat `<img>` in responsive design
-Also understand why we use and how to write the `srcset` attribute of an `<img>` element
-there are dozens of elements that can comprise a media query but we will deal only with how we have been writing it:

`@media only screen and (min-width:480px){ ... }` or `@media (max-width: 12450px) { ... }`

CSS3:
-will not test on anything from this CSS3 Extravaganza class

Bootstrap:
-Know about "Frontend" vs "Backend"
-What is it and why is it used? Know some of it's history.

Forms:
Freebie, there will be no FORMS questions on the test.

Audio/Video:
-know how to write out the video and audio element as well as some of the options you have in writing them out. The final will not include questions of some of the third party software we used to handle or export those files.

JQuery:
-What is it and why do we use it?
-Know where to put scripts in our HTML document and the various types of methods of putting the in.
-Be able to dissect a JQuery object and know how to write it. You will be tested on how you retrieve HTML elements.
-I will only use JQuery methods/functions that are obvious in their use like `addClass`. This is so that you know what the object is doing at all times. 

Javascript:
-most important sections to understand: variables, operators, types, console, comments
-what is a property, method, and library? 
-know how to recognize the components of an `if` statement
