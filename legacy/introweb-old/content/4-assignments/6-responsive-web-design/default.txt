Responsive Assignment
DUE NOV. 16

In this assignment, you will  incorporate CSS media queries into the design from the last assignment. 

This will allow your page layout to change based on whether a visitor to your site is using a smartphone, tablet, or desktop computer. With media queries, you can anticipate and design for a variety of viewing experiences.

Where in the last assignment, you only needed to code up the home page, you will continue with coding up the rest of the pages for this assignment.  Each of the web pages should include images and/or text and there should be clear navigation between each of the pages.

Also, create a custom website icon (favicon) and add it to all pages of the site (32px × 32px, 72ppi, PNG or GIF format).

**MEDIA QUERIES**
Next, you will integrate one or more media queries into your code to set breakpoints for the layout. Media queries can assess a viewer’s browser width and use that information to determine which styles to use for the page. For example, a three-column layout could be used for desktop viewing, a two-column layout for tablets, and a one-column layout for smartphones. Feel free to use the below or use your own.

   `<!-- Media query for narrow browser width -->`
  ` <link rel="stylesheet" media="only screen and (max-width: 480px)" href="mobile.css">`

   `<!-- Media query for medium browser width -->`
   `<link rel="stylesheet" media="only screen and (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 960px)" href="tablet.css">`

  ` <!-- Media query for full browser width -->`
   `<link rel="stylesheet" media="only screen and (min-width: 961px)" href="desktop.css">`

  ` <!-- Prevent smartphones from scaling pages down -->`
   `<meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1">`

Since you’ll be optimizing your layout for different screen sizes, you should set the viewport on all pages to an initial scale of 1 to prevent smartphones and other devices from scaling pages down:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

You may want to begin with a simpler, mobile-optimized layout; your media query could then be used to expand the layout to multiple columns for a wider viewing experience. The desktop layout should include two or more columns with the CSS float or flex property. Structure your HTML code with divisions in order to position sections of content alongside each other when appropriate.

**RESPONSIVE IMAGES**
The resolution of computer displays varies across devices. To optimize your bitmap images for screens with higher resolutions, you can offer larger alternates. To that end, create 2x versions at double the width and height of all your standard website images. Rather than scaling up the smaller image (which would result in lower quality), you should work with original image files to create the 2x versions. Then, use the HTML img element’s srcset attribute along with the src attribute to offer these to compatible browsers.

**Publishing Your Website**
Upload your website to the i6 Unix server in its own directory. Test your files again once they are live on the Web server to make sure they are accessible. Update your assignments directory to link to this page.

**Submitting Your Assignment**
Submit the following via NYU Classes. .

The URL to your website on i6
A compressed archive containing all the files of your website
