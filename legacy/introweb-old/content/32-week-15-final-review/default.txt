__________

Design and Wireframing:
-understand the principles behind design and wireframing. Think about why it is such an important step in web development and process.
-I expect you to be able to pick out the most logical site map and wireframing mockups for a given scenario. I'll give you a situation (agency/client relationship and target market) and present you with options.

Responsive Web Design:
-Why do we prioritize it?
-Know how to write media queries and know about what they are doing when you look at them (are they overwriting previous media queries, are they mobile first, etc.). Essentially know what they are saying. 
-Know about how we treat `<img>` in responsive design
-Also understand why we use and how to write the `srcset` attribute of an `<img>` element
-there are dozens of elements that can comprise a media query but we will deal only with how we have been writing it:

`@media only screen and (min-width:480px){ ... }` or `@media (max-width: 12450px) { ... }`

CSS3:
-it was fun but I am not going to test you on anything here.

Bootstrap:
-Know about "Frontend" vs "Backend"
-What is it and why is it used? Know some of it's history.
-I'm not going to get super particular about how you write the Carousel code or other components for example, but there are some generalities I went over in class about the grid system, columns, fluid vs not that I think are most important when leveraging the grid system of bootstrap. 

Forms:
Because I didn't go over this in class, this section is for your own information. Nothing on forms will be covered in the final.

Audio/Video:
-know how to write out the video and audio element as well as some of the options you have in writing them out. The final will not include questions of some of the third party software we used to handle or export those files.

JQuery:
-What is it and why do we use it?
-Know where to put scripts in our HTML document and the various types of methods of putting the in.
-Be able to dissect a JQuery object and know how to write it. You will be tested on how you retrieve HTML elements.
-I will only use JQuery methods/functions that are obvious in their use like `addClass`. This is so that you know what the object is doing at all times. 

Javascript:
-understand why we use variables
-know how to recognize the components of an `if` statement
-know about the Date() object and how we can get the specific elements of time we want to display.

Domain Names, Hosting, SEO, Analytics:
-we went over a bunch of informational tidbits on the above. KNOW THEM!
