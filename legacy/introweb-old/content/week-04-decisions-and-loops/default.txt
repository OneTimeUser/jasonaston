**Lecture**

This week will be talking about decisions and loops using JavaScript. Decisions are made in code using if statements, i.e. if this value is 5 or above make the background blue if its below 5 make the background red. Loops are one of the main things that makes programming great! We can loop through a large number of tasks and the computer will do those tasks pretty much instantly. For this we use something called a for loop or a while loop.
