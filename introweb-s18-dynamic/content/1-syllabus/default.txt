All assignments—including attachments—should be submitted via (link: https://newclasses.nyu.edu/ text:  NYU Classes). See instructions below.

Assignments that you turn in should be your own work. It’s fine to talk to other students and to get assistance in how to do something, but you should not ask another person to do the work for you. For reference, here is the (link: http://www.cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/academic_integrity text: Computer Science Department’s statement on academic integrity).

It is important not to get behind in turning in assignments. If you do get behind, we still want you to do the assignment; it is better to turn in a late assignment than to skip it. However, late assignments are penalized as follows: 10% during the first week late, 20% during the second week late, and 30% during the third week after the due date. Homework will not be accepted past the third week after its assigned due date without prior permission. Likewise, no assignments will be accepted after the final exam.

###i6 Account###
In addition to your NYU Home Account, we will be using a special computer account on a Unix Web server which will be assigned to you automatically based on your enrollment. This is called an (link: http://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/resources/i6 text: “i6” )account and we will use it to host our websites. Common questions about i6 accounts are answered on (link: https://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/resources/i6/faq text: this FAQ page). If you forget your i6 password and would like to reset it, go to (link: https://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/resources/i6/resetpassword text:  this page) for instructions on how to do so.


###Software###
Macintosh computers with all of the necessary software installed are available to you in the (link: https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/locations-and-facilities/student-technology-centers.html text: Student Technology Centers). You do not need  your own computer nor do you need to purchase any software. However, you will be learning how to use various programs and may wish to have access to them at home or on your laptop. In this case, you must purchase a subscription or use a trial version, which is sometimes available from the publisher.
