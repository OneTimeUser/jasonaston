Quick Note: if you need or desire more tutelage on responsive design and positioning elements then talk to me. I can prepare some extra materials for further study. But also don't stress, this is the bane of most intro web developers. Once you get it though (and you may never totally totally get it ;)) it becomes a real AHA! moment. 

Today we took a look a ONE framework (among many) that helps jump start the front end web development process: Bootstrap. We also talked about what are some of the characteristics of front end web development and back end development.

Bootstrap is a front end framework for developing responsive, mobile-first projects on the Web. It contains HTML and CSS design templates as well as optional JavaScript extensions.

Originally developed as an internal toolkit for Twitter, the project was released as open-source code in 2010. It has since become one of the most popular front end Web frameworks and is used by many different kinds of sites.

There are two ways to integrate Bootstrap into your project.  The easiest is to link to the necessary Bootstrap stylesheet and javascript files by including them in your HTML document like below:

```
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Hello, world!</title>
    <!-- Required meta tags -->
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">

    <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0-beta.2/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-PsH8R72JQ3SOdhVi3uxftmaW6Vc51MKb0q5P2rRUpPvrszuE4W1povHYgTpBfshb" crossorigin="anonymous">
   <!-- Your custom CSS -->
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="myStyles.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>

    <!-- Optional JavaScript -->
    <!-- jQuery first, then Popper.js, then Bootstrap JS -->
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-KJ3o2DKtIkvYIK3UENzmM7KCkRr/rE9/Qpg6aAZGJwFDMVNA/GpGFF93hXpG5KkN" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.12.3/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-vFJXuSJphROIrBnz7yo7oB41mKfc8JzQZiCq4NCceLEaO4IHwicKwpJf9c9IpFgh" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

  </body>
</html>
```

Like I said, it is but one frontend framework in a vary crowded and opinionated field. But it is the most popular and it solves a lot of problems so that you can get to designing and coding. 

Remember that Bootstrap's strengths and ease come from it's classes. It behooves you to take a look at what the various classes can do so that you can cut down on custom, superfluous code.  Check out that side menu (link: http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/ text:here) and go through every page. It's a lot of information and it is common practice to have this informative website open or some other resource like this (link: https://hackerthemes.com/bootstrap-cheatsheet/ text: cheat sheet of Bootstrap classes)

The grid system will probably be one of the most important in creating the general layout of your site and solves a particular pain point of responsive design and alignment. 

The most simplest iteration looks something like this:
```
<div class="container"> 
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
                One of three columns
            </div>
            <div class="col">
                One of three columns
            </div>
            <div class="col">
                One of three columns
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
```
The above creates three equal centered columns with fixed width. Now try changing `container` to `container-fluid` and see that the width is no longer fixed, rather extends the length of the document (width:100%).
Containers provide a means to center and horizontally pad your siteâ€™s contents. Use `.container` for a responsive fixed pixel width or `.container-fluid` for width: 100% across all viewport and device sizes.
Rows are wrappers for columns and comes with padding.
If you don't use a number in the class name, the column will be equally spaced, otherwise you can arrange size or width of columns based on a grid of 12 per row.  So the above ex could also be written as `.col-4` or `.col-sm-4`.

This chart shows you the breakdowns.

|   |Bootstrap | Responsive| Breakpoints | And | Classes|
|  ---  |  ---  |  ---  |  ---  |  ---  |  ---  |
|    |Extra Small | Small | Medium | Large | Extra Large |
|   | <576px | >= 576px | >= 768px | >=992px | >=1200px |
|  Max Width of Container | none (auto) | 540px | 720px | 960px | 1140px |
|  Class Prefix | .col- | .col-sm- | .col-md- | .com-lg- | .col-xl- |
|  # columns | 12---> |  |  |  |  |
|  Gutter Width 30px (15px on each side of column) |  |  |  | |  |

From the previous code, you see that without adding a number to the class name, Bootstrap will equalize the width across all of the columns you have included. You can also just set one column to a numbered width like the below:
```
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
      1 of 3
    </div>
    <div class="col-6">
      2 of 3 (wider)
    </div>
    <div class="col">
      3 of 3
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
      1 of 3
    </div>
    <div class="col-5">
      2 of 3 (wider)
    </div>
    <div class="col">
      3 of 3
    </div>
  </div>
</div> 
```
The middle column of the first row will take up 6/12ths or 1/2 of the width of the container (in the middle). The second will take up 5/12ths.
Should you want to column to "hug" the content, that is not specify its width but make it as wide as the content, use the following class: `col-md-auto`.

Because this is a mobile first framework, if you wanted your content to look the same across ALL devices, then stick with the `col` class.  
A common solve for mobile devices is to stack everything on mobile then display horizontal for all other devices, knowing what we know, we would make sure our class is `col-sm` so that everything below (`.col-sm`) stacks while everything above displays horizontally. 

Perhaps you have two elements that you don't want to take up the entire width of the container nor do they occupy all twelve sections of our imaginary grid. Use row classes to help make them look the way you want. 
```
<div class="container">
  <div class="row justify-content-around"> //equal spacing around
    <div class="col-4">
      One of two columns
    </div>
    <div class="col-4">
      One of two columns
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row justify-content-between"> //equal spacing in between (nothing on outside)
    <div class="col-4">
      One of two columns
    </div>
    <div class="col-4">
      One of two columns
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

We can also nest rows in other rows for even more complex layout! Also pay attention to the double classes in the columns. This states essentially that we want different layouts on x-small devices than we do on small devices and above. 
```
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-9">
    Level 1: .col-sm-9
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-8 col-sm-6">
        Level 2: .col-8 .col-sm-6
      </div>
      <div class="col-4 col-sm-6">
        Level 2: .col-4 .col-sm-6
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Additional tips:
Centering outside of the row/columns use `class="text-center"`
Responsive images use `class="img-fluid"`
Image Thumbs use `class="img-thumbnail"`

Best to check this codepen out on the codepen site where you can drag the window:
<p data-height="400" data-theme-id="dark" data-slug-hash="YEEBRR" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="onetimeuser" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Bootstrap 4 Flexbox Grid" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/onetimeuser/pen/YEEBRR/">Bootstrap 4 Flexbox Grid</a> by Onetimeuser (<a href="https://codepen.io/onetimeuser">@onetimeuser</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>

Components:
There are many components you can use to make your life easier. But here are a few I think are most relevant for you.

Basic Navigation:
The code below is the most basic implementation of a navigation. Here I used simple `<a>` elements but this can also be made with unordered lists. There are some quirks regarding necessary classes `nav-link` and `nav-item`. They are not always necessary together but some classes will not work if `nav-item` is not present (like vertical stacking menu).
```
<nav class="nav">
  <a class="nav-link nav-item active" href="#">Active</a>
  <a class="nav-link nav-item" href="#">Link</a>
  <a class="nav-link nav-item" href="#">Link</a>
  <a class="nav-link nav-item disabled" href="#">Disabled</a>
</nav>
```
For centering add a class to the nav `<nav class="nav justify-content-center">` or to place the nav on the right `<nav class="nav justify-content-end">`.
For vertical stacking `<nav class="nav flex-column">`
To space the nav elements out across the width of the container or page `<nav class="nav nav-fill">` or `<nav class="nav nav-justified">`
To make a button like (referred to as "pills") nav use `<nav class="nav nav-pill">`

Here is some code to create what is called a Nav Bar. You can see an implementation of this on Bootstrap's website. It is their navigation bar and includes a search function and automatic responsiveness on mobile (hamburger menu).  The code is lengthy so you should take some time to understand most of it so you can implement the way you want.
```
<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light">
  <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">Navbar</a>
  <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbarSupportedContent" aria-controls="navbarSupportedContent" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
    <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
  </button>

  <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarSupportedContent">
    <ul class="navbar-nav mr-auto">
      <li class="nav-item active">
        <a class="nav-link" href="#">Home <span class="sr-only">(current)</span></a>
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link" href="#">Link</a>
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item dropdown">
        <a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" href="#" id="navbarDropdown" role="button" data-toggle="dropdown" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">
          Dropdown
        </a>
        <div class="dropdown-menu" aria-labelledby="navbarDropdown">
          <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Action</a>
          <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Another action</a>
          <div class="dropdown-divider"></div>
          <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Something else here</a>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link disabled" href="#">Disabled</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <form class="form-inline my-2 my-lg-0">
      <input class="form-control mr-sm-2" type="search" placeholder="Search" aria-label="Search">
      <button class="btn btn-outline-success my-2 my-sm-0" type="submit">Search</button>
    </form>
  </div>
</nav>
```

Carousel of images is a fairly common function of modern websites. It's not that hard to implement thanks to Bootstrap:
```
<div id="carouselExampleIndicators" class="carousel slide" data-ride="carousel">
  <ol class="carousel-indicators">
    <li data-target="#carouselExampleIndicators" data-slide-to="0" class="active"></li>
    <li data-target="#carouselExampleIndicators" data-slide-to="1"></li>
    <li data-target="#carouselExampleIndicators" data-slide-to="2"></li>
  </ol>
  <div class="carousel-inner">
    <div class="carousel-item active">
      <img class="d-block w-100" src="..." alt="First slide">
    </div>
    <div class="carousel-item">
      <img class="d-block w-100" src="..." alt="Second slide">
    </div>
    <div class="carousel-item">
      <img class="d-block w-100" src="..." alt="Third slide">
    </div>
  </div>
  <a class="carousel-control-prev" href="#carouselExampleIndicators" role="button" data-slide="prev">
    <span class="carousel-control-prev-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
    <span class="sr-only">Previous</span>
  </a>
  <a class="carousel-control-next" href="#carouselExampleIndicators" role="button" data-slide="next">
    <span class="carousel-control-next-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
    <span class="sr-only">Next</span>
  </a>
</div>
```

Modal's are pretty cool and can be used to give your site some nifty interaction while also decluttering it. These are pop overs or overlays that appear upon clicking a button or photo.  You can use this to show a more detailed image after a user clicks a thumbnail.

```
<!-- Button trigger modal -->
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#exampleModal">
  Launch demo modal
</button>

<!-- Modal -->
<div class="modal fade" id="exampleModal" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="exampleModalLabel" aria-hidden="true">
  <div class="modal-dialog" role="document">
    <div class="modal-content">
      <div class="modal-header">
        <h5 class="modal-title" id="exampleModalLabel">Modal title</h5>
        <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close">
          <span aria-hidden="true">Ã—</span>
        </button>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
        ...
      </div>
      <div class="modal-footer">
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" data-dismiss="modal">Close</button>
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Save changes</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Because of it's modular nature, you can copy and paste and reuse these.
