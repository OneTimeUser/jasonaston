**CSS Grid**

Grid layout enables an author to align elements into columns and rows, thus is a a two-dimensional grid system (defining columns AND rows vs. one dimensional as we will soon see with Flexbox). Grids can be used to layout major page areas or small user interface elements.

The grid can be fixed sizes (using pixels), or flexible with percentages or the `fr` unit.

Grid contains alignment features so that we can control how the items align once placed into a grid area, and how the entire grid is aligned.

*Creating a Grid*

We create a grid container by declaring display: grid or display: inline-grid on an element. As soon as we do this all direct children of that element will become grid items.

Try the following:

**index.html**
```
<div class="wrapper">
  <div>One</div>
  <div>Two</div>
  <div>Three</div>
  <div>Four</div>
  <div>Five</div>
</div>
```

**styles.css**
```
* {box-sizing: border-box;}

.wrapper {
  display: grid;
  border: 2px solid #f76707;
  background-color: aqua;
}


.wrapper > div {
  border: 2px solid #ffa94d;
  border-radius: 5px;
  background-color: #ffd8a8;
  padding: 1em;
  color: #d9480f;
}


```

In the above example, we have a `div` wrapper element containing five child `div`'s. IN the CSS, we give the `display` property of the wrapping `div` called `.wrapper` a value of `grid`. Voila, you have created a grid. We have only just become, as while technically a grid, we haven't added columns to make it more interesting.

We define rows and columns on our grid with the `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` properties. These define grid tracks. A grid track is the space between any two lines on the grid. 

So let's add the following to our `.wrapper` in our CSS: `grid-template-columns: 200px 200px 200px;`

As you can see, the grid is now comprised of three 200px wide tracks that we have defined by repeating the `200px` value three times. Remember you can also use percentages here. But lets try using a new unit called `fr` which represents a fraction of the available space inside of our grid and is a flexible value.

So lets replace what we just pasted inside of `.wrapper` with `grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;`. Now see what happens? We have three flexible equal width columns. No try changing some of the values, maybe a `.5fr` and/or a `2fr`. Play around with it so you get the feel of what to expect when you start sizing the grid. We are essentially adding up all of the number values in front of `fr` then allocating the space accordingly. NO pixel sizes needed. 

While we are on the subject, try using a pixel size for one of the values instead of `fr`. The grid allocates the pixel dimensions you have stated then splits up the rest into proper widths. Drag the window out and in and you can see that while the fixed pixel dimension stays the same, the flexible `fr` units accommodate the rest of the width of the window. 

The line `grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;` can also be written (for brevity) using the `repeat` notation like so: `grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);`.

You can even use `repeat` to really mix up your grid like for example: `grid-template-columns: 20px repeat(6, 1fr) 20px;`. Here we create a `20px` column then `repeat` 6 columns at `1fr` a piece then end with a 20px column.

Don't forget that if you don't have as many CHILDREN in your grid wrapper as columns you've defined, then the grid section will be blank.

Notice that we have only declared our columns so far. If we declare them, it's known as explicit. If we haven't, then it's called implicit. Our number rows have been implied, hence, implicit. We leave it up to the grid to add extra grid cells when needed, like when our `div` children exceeds our defined columns and a new row is created to house them. We can set our grid cell sizes if we want using `grid-auto-rows` or `grid-auto-columns`. So try adding the following to our working example in the `.wrapper` style rule: `grid-auto-rows: 200px;`. Now you see that we have given our grid rows a fixed height. You can also use the `minmax` function to define the minimum and maximum for your tracks. Like maybe you would never want a row to be below 100px in height but also you would want it to accommodate anything above 100px, you would write that like so : `grid-auto-rows: minmax(100px, auto);`.

So far we have been working with a grid with somewhat equal tracks from row to row. Let's talk about how we might define these tracks more individually. 

We can do this by accessing and defining the children of the wrapping element according to grid lines. Grid lines are what you imagine they are. Think of a grid, lets say a three column and two row grid. There are 4 columnal lines that make up the grid and 3 row lines. We use these numbered lines (from right to left) as a means to define the extent of each child. Let's look at the following code: 

**index.html**
```
<div class="wrapper">
  <div class="box1">One</div>
  <div class="box2">Two</div>
  <div class="box3">Three</div>
  <div class="box4">Four</div>
  <div class="box5">Five</div>
</div>
```

**styles.css**
```
* {box-sizing: border-box;}

.wrapper { 
  display: grid; 
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); 
  grid-auto-rows: 100px; 
  border: 2px solid #f76707;
  border-radius: 5px;
  background-color: #fff4e6;
}


.wrapper > div {
  border: 2px solid #ffa94d;
  border-radius: 5px;
  background-color: #ffd8a8;
  padding: 1em;
  color: #d9480f;
}

.box1 { 
  grid-column-start: 1; 
  grid-column-end: 4; 
  grid-row-start: 1; 
  grid-row-end: 3; 
}

.box2 { 
  grid-column-start: 1; 
  grid-row-start: 3; 
  grid-row-end: 5; 
}

```

We have pretty much begun to markup some more complex designs for a possible page. 

Lets explore a few other style rules you can add to your CSS. 

We can define gutters or gaps between the cells in our grid. We do this using `grid-column-gap` and `grid-row-gap`. Try adding the following to the `.wrapper` elements style rules: 
```
grid-column-gap: 10px;
grid-row-gap: 1em;
```

**CSS FLEXBOX**

While CSS Grids are two-dimensional layout system, Flexbox is one dimensional, meaning defining for rows OR columns. The children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can “flex” their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent.

Let's look at this basic example of flexbox:
**index.html**
```
<div class="box">
  <div>One</div>
  <div>Two</div>
  <div>Three really messes stuff up huh?
      <br>has
      <br>extra
      <br>text
  </div>
</div>
```

**styles.css**
```
.box {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row; /*this is the default value do does not need to be stated. Can be `column`*/
    justify-content: space-between;
}

.box > div{
  background-color: rgba(0,0,255,0.5)
}
```

This is an interesting example for the following reasons. We have the `div` children, three of them to be exact, that are equally spaced apart according to the width of EACH `div`. So we instantiate the flexbox using `display:flex;` on the `.box` wrapper. Then we define the direction we want our flexibility, either as a row or column. The spacing magic happens when we add `justify-content: space-between;` to the element. Stretch the window back and forth and you see how the container stretches and condenses, adjusting the space between to keep all elements on one line.

We can create multi-line flex containers by adding a `flex-wrap` property to our container. Try adding it to the above code in the `.box` wrapper. Now you see that when the space becomes an issue, a new row is created to keep things nice and clean.

ONe thing to note, you can combine `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap` in one shorthand called `flex-flow` like this: `flex-flow: row wrap;`.

To have more control over our flex items we can target them directly by using the `flex` property:

There are also some predefined shorthand values which cover most of the use cases. You will often see these used in tutorials, and in many cases these are all you will need to use. The predefined values are as follows:

-`flex: initial` resets the item to the initial values of Flexbox- the items will not grow and expand but can shrink.
-`flex: auto` allows the items to grow and shrink in equal spacing between them
-`flex: none` items will not grow or shrink
-`flex: <positive-number>` works much like the grid. You would give the items in your HTML a number that is part of the whole to control spacing. 

Check the following: 
**index.html**
```
<div class="box">
    <div class="one">One</div>
    <div class="two">Two</div>
    <div class="three">Three</div>
</div>
```

**styles.css**
```
.box {
        display: flex;
  }

  .one {
    flex: 1;
    background-color: red;
  }

  .two {
    flex: 2;
    background-color: aqua;
  }

  .three {
    flex: 4;
    background-color: lavender;
  }
```

The property `align-items` aligns items on the cross axis, that is the axis opposite what you declared in the `flex-direction` property (remember by default this property is set to `row` as usually we are looking to flex our layout width wise).

The initial value for this property is `stretch` and this is why flex items stretch to the height of the tallest one by default. They are in fact stretching to fill the flex container — the tallest item is defining the height of that.

The other values for this are `flex-start`, `flex-end`, and `center`. Lets take the following example. Switch out the align-items property to get an idea of what each one does.

**index.html**
```
<div class="box">
      <div>One</div>
      <div>Two</div>
      <div>Three
          <br>has
          <br>extra
          <br>text
      </div>
    </div>
```

**styles.css**
```
.box {
    display: flex;
    align-items: stretch;
  }
.box > div {
    background-color: aqua;
    border: 2px solid orange;
}
```

The `justify-content` property we talked about earlier aligns elements on the main axis, that is the one that is declared in your `flex-direction` property. Add this property to the above example and swap out the following properties to see what they do:
-`stretch`
-`flex-start`
-`flex-end`
-`center`
-`space-around`
-`space-between`
-`space-evenly`

Let's take a look at the following example of flex to see how it reacts differently than the Grid. 

**index.html**
```
<div class="wrapper">
  <div>One</div>
  <div>Two</div>
  <div>Three</div>
  <div>Four</div>
  <div>Five</div>
</div>
```

**styles.css**
```
* {box-sizing: border-box;}

.wrapper {
  border: 2px solid #f76707;
  border-radius: 5px;
  background-color: #fff4e6;
}

.wrapper > div {
  border: 2px solid #ffa94d;
  border-radius: 5px;
  background-color: #ffd8a8;
  padding: 1em;
  color: #d9480f;
}
.wrapper {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}
.wrapper > div {
  flex: 1 1 200px;
}


```

Notice how some of the items drop to a new row when the width becomes too narrow. Notice that there are three items on top and two on the bottom but they aren't lined up like we have in the grid. We can begin to see how Flexbox as a layout tool is limiting where Grids can pick up the slack.  

A simple question to ask yourself when deciding between grid or flexbox is:

do I only need to control the layout by row or column – use a flexbox!
do I need to control the layout by row and column – use a grid!

I think most of the time you will find a need for flexbox WITHIN your grid. 

An ideal use case for flexbox is when you have a set of items and want to space them out evenly in a container. You let the size of the content decide how much individual space each item takes up. If the items wrap onto a new line, they will work out their spacing based on their size and the available space in that line.

When you use CSS Grid Layout you create a layout and then you place items into it, or you allow the auto-placement rules to place the items into the grid cells according to that strict grid.

In your freetime, explore the code and behavior of the following to really start to hone in on why and when you might use either the grid or flexbox.
