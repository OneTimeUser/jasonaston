###Course Description###
This is an advanced website design and development class focusing on front-end development (HTML, CSS and JavaScript). The main focus for this class will be using JavaScript to create websites that include motion, interaction and data retrieval using publicly available APIs (Application Programming Interface) like live weather data, Facebook data, etc. We will also be covering a handful of JavaScript frameworks like jQuery, p5js, D3js and Bootstrap. The class will be discussing how to create interactive websites for both desktop platforms, mobile and tablet. This class could collaborate with the App Design class to build out the designed Apps.

Class participation is mandatory. You are expected to be present; to participate in a positive, constructive manner; and to produce work that is full of energy and completed and presented to the best of your ability.

It is your responsibility to turn in work on time, to make up any missed assignments, and to catch up with the class in the event of an absence.

This is a hands-on course, and regular attendance is necessary for participation. You will be graded on in-class participation. If you know you are going to be absent, contact the professor by email in advance. Students who miss numerous classes will find it difficult to pass the course. Visual assignments and projects will be graded based on: one for technical merit, concept and your demonstrated ability to understand the material. Your final grades will be calculated by the following: 80% project, 20% participation. You are expected to spend as much time working outside the classroom as you work inside the classroom. Schedule your time accordingly.

You will need to have a notebook or sketchbook that you will be expected to bring to every class, as well as a 4gb or larger thumbdrive to transfer digital files, and earphones for listening to video tutorials in class.
