**VISUAL AIDES:**
These are helpful in helping you find the right format for what it is you are showing. These are not exhaustive nor definitive.

**ASSIGNMENT:**
Using one of your printed out images (or objects) as the subject, create a visualization of that subject- telling whatever story you want to tell using the various organizations, visual cues, and forms you know now. 

Some of you brought in images on only one subject, e.g. books, makeup, music, scary Korean beauty mask, so that is the subject you are working with. Feel free to modify or go a level deeper if it feels worthwhile. If you feel confident enough to start layering in complexity, do it.   

Of course, I am always here to answer questions or clarify: astoj809@newschool.edu.
