What is data visualization?  What is not data visualization? Why do we create data visualizations? What are the many examples and history of data visualizations.

ASSIGNMENT:

The different ways in which we can organize information is one of the most powerful factors influencing how people perceive and interact with a visualization. The book Universal Principles of Design demonstrates five different ways that information can be organized. They are called the Five Hat Racks, or LATCH: Location, Alphabet, Time, Category, and Hierarchy (or magnitude).

Collect a dozen or more images describing a group of related items in your life. Good choices include books, movies, music, the contents of your fridge or closet, or anything else you might collect or interact with. Record the metadata corresponding to the LATCH attributes for each item.

Bring the image collection (printed out, please!) and metadata to class on Monday, Sept. 19. We will be assembling different taxonomies from your collections using the various LATCH methods.
