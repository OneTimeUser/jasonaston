**CAMPUS RESOURCES**
The university provides many resources to help students achieve academic and artistic excellence. These resources include:

The University (and associated) Libraries: http://library.newschool.edu
The University Learning Center: http://www.newschool.edu/learning-center
University Disabilities Service: www.newschool.edu/student-disability-services/

In keeping with the university’s policy of providing equal access for students with disabilities, any student with a disability who needs academic accommodations is welcome to meet with me privately. All conversations will be kept confidential. Students requesting any accommodations will also need to contact Student Disability Service (SDS). SDS will conduct an intake and, if appropriate, the Director will provide an academic accommodation notification letter for you to bring to me. At that point, I will review the letter with you and discuss these accommodations in relation to this course.

**MAKING CENTER**
The Making Center is a constellation of shops, labs, and open workspaces that are situated across the New School to help students express their ideas in a variety of materials and methods.  We have resources to help support woodworking, metalworking, ceramics and pottery work, photography and film, textiles, printmaking, 3D printing, manual and CNC machining, and more. A staff of technicians and student workers provide expertise and maintain the different shops and labs.  Safety is a primary concern, so each area has policies for access, training, and etiquette that students and faculty should be familiar with. Many areas require specific orientations or trainings before access is granted.  Detailed information about the resources available, as well as schedules, trainings, and policies can be found at resources.parsons.edu.
