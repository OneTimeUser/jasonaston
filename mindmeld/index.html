		<p>Vulcan Mind Meld Mask was a fantasy project commenting on mediated intimacy and the inevitable possibilities/dangers involved in the continually radicalization of relationship.  It consists of two stand alone but integrated works- the physical mask complete with packaging and a manual as well as a related short story. </p>

			It was literally burning a hole in his bag. The wax coating on the exterior pooled in droplets that hung at the bottom for a second until gravity won them over.</p>
		<p>"Mom, my bag is hot! It's burning my back!"</p>
		<p>"What? Come here!" She pulled him close. They were in the parking lot of a mall about five minutes from their house. It was the boy's birthday, and a solid day of shopping yielded a "toy" from the Discovery Store, the only one left; it had been returned only five minutes prior to them walking in and asking for it. The boy had seen the commercial on television: "The Vulcan Mind Meld Mask! No one is ever too far away!"</p>
		<p>Promises of a pseudo tangible interaction with someone anywhere in the universe never meant that much to him until his father left five years ago. He said he was leaving to "make sure he and mommy stay safe."</p>
		<p>"I told you not to open the package! It's too hot outside to have this in your bag!" The manual cautioned against extreme heat. The day's temperature had reached 65 ̊C. She placed it in her purse- all made of insulated foil to keep things inside relatively stable.</p>
		<p>She opened the door to the house. The cool air from inside could not be cool enough. The walk from the car was dizzyingly oppressive, the heat from the sun beating on their skin with the intensity of a bass drum.</p>
		<p>Once inside, the boy ran to his room and leapt for his bed. "Mommy, Mommy,...MASK MASK!"</p>
		<p>His mother came in and tossed the toy on the bed. It was 4 in the evening, and his father would only be awake for a couple more hours. "Read the instructions before you do anything. Then come get me; I'll be in the kitchen."</p>
		<p>The boy slid the mask out of it's bag. Bone white. He picked it up and ran his fingers over the surface. Textured, like the pages of a book they had on display at his school. This made him want one. He set it down and inverted the packaging. Some other components fell out: a small battery the size of a pill, a bound cord and a leaflet manual of poor Martian quality. He grabbed the manual and began to read.</p>
		<p>His mother sat down at the kitchen table, weary from the day trip. She picked up a small screen lying a couple feet from her, the size a notecard and translucent, edgeless even. It immediately turned on. The screen filled with words begging to be touched: "Local News, National News, Entertainment, Sports, Lifestyle, Arts". She chose local news and started at the top. After a couple minutes, the phone rang. It was her sister. If the screen remained idle for more than five minutes, it is programmed to turn off. It turned off. His mother stayed on the phone for ten minutes. Afterwards, she returned to the screen only to realize that she had lost her place. The begging words reappeared and this time, she chose "Entertainment."</p>
		<p>Had the phone not rang, and had she continued reading all the way down the page, his mother would have encountered the following:</p>

		￼<p><b>'Mind Meld Mask' Link with Boy's Crime</b></p>
		<p><em>A boy aged 16 who used Jasco's Mind Meld Mask to mercilessly pummel a friend in metaphysical world went on a rampage shortly thereafter, harming four more in the ensuing violence. He was apprehended later on that day as witnesses described the boy's whereabouts.</p>
		<p>The boy told the police that his friends "egged him to attack his friend because he wouldn't actually get hurt." The boy also said that afterward, his mind was in such a frenzy that he could not stop himself.</p>
		<p>The unidentified victim said he suffered from serious mental abuse from the ordeal.</p>
		<p>The irresistable conclusion was that it was the influence of the mask. Many people had much to answer for, whether they were heads of Jasco, department stores, or suppliers. Professor Oren Sessions, head of Psychiatry at New York University says, "It has produced a canker among the impressionable young, which all reasonable people desire to see stamped out at once".</p>
		<p>Mr Roger Gray, for the defence, said: "The link between this crime and such metaphysical toys, particularly the mask, is established beyond any reasonable doubt". </p>

		</div>
		<p>"Finished!" Technically, he only read the instructions and nothing else.</p>
		<p>He took the cable and inserted one end into the mask and the other into his keyboard. A small hole on the keyboards face immediately filled with light, and right before him, an ethereal red screen appeared. The screen asked for a ten digit IIN number, someone's International Identification Number. He pulled a wrinkled piece of plastic out of his bag. On it was stamped "Dad - 4345590832".</p>
		<p>The International Civil Identification Organization came into power in 2035, when the first of the human convoy to Mars was attacked and destroyed by unknown beings on Mars. The ship had not even landed. Almost all of the Earth world called for retaliation in unison. For every person calling for diplomacy or peaceful talks, there were a thousand ready to pounce. In the paranoia, the more conservative factions of the United Nations called for identifying and tagging numerically every earth citizen. Those opposed were soon threatened and strong-armed into conceding. The vote was unanimous. The operation took a few years. Soon, everyone had a number and everyone was forcibly "tagged" with a smart chip that reported geo-coordinates, bio- and behaviometrics.</p>
		<p>The boy input the number and pushed ENTER. The projection went gray for a few seconds before the mask vibrated and glowed green.</p>
		<p>The mother dragged her finger across the headlines looking for a story that could occupy her for the few moments she had before tending to dinner. So many useless stories. She could remember how entertainment use to be. True performers and masters of the craft. Now, all that infiltrated news was sex tapes of unknown stars, drug addiction, failed marriages, and rumors of sex tapes. There at least used to be some class. Her eyes flitted through the rest of the section before she let out a sigh, setting the screen down once again on the table and embarking on dinner.</p>
		<p>She failed to catch the headline staring right back at her.</p>

		￼<p><b>Rights Bought for Boy and Notorious Mask</b></p>
		<p><em>London-- Rights have been bought to the story concerning a teenager sentenced to 8 years in prison for hacking a Vulcan Mind Meld Mask and terrorizing his enemies, some to the point of hospitalization.</p>
		<p>New York Times, July 5, 2046.</em></p>
</div>
		<p>The boy placed his fingers on the mask as directed, and closed his eyes. A sensation shot through his body, unfamiliar and invasive. It took him a couple of seconds to adjust and to remember to "think of a place." He was afraid he could not remember, could not focus. But he did. He could not forget the place where his father said goodbye.</p>
		<p>And here he was: not a beach or some enchanted forest. It was right outside, in front of this house he was raised for eleven years, five of them before the ozone went away, when he and his father played outside on the lawn. This house, this lawn. Where his father knelt beside him and said goodbye.</p>
		<p>He looked around and did not see his father. A part of him knew that something like this was too good to be true. Seeing him and playing with him even though he was light years away. The day was right. The location was right. The toy worked to this extent. Then a shuffle. The ground seemed unsteady and hollow. He looked down to see his father beneath him, smiling up.</p>
		<p>"Are you going to stay on me forever?" the father asked. "Yes," the boy said.</p>
