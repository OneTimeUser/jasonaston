**Lecture**

This week will be discussing AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) and the data format JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) to load data into our webpage without reloading the entire page. We will also talk about APIs (application programming interfaces) allow your website to interact with other third party databases like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to pull in live data and present it on your own website. Today we will be focusing on the Open Weather Map API and the Facebook API.
