Today we continued talking about other elements of responsive web design. In addition to media queries, we talked about the necessity to include the following meta tag to the `<head>` element:
`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,  initial-scale=1.0">`

We also learned about best ways to treat `<img>` images. In general, it's best to keep the css for images like so:
`img{ width= 100%; height= auto;}` or setting the `max-width= 100%`.  This ensures the image doesn't distort out of its natural aspect ratio and it doesn't grow beyond its natural pixel size. Usually this means that in order to size your images in your layout correctly, they are contained in a `div` or `section` element which is where a variable width is placed. 

We introduced a new attribute in the `img` tag that allows us to have the browser choose the best image out of an image set to display to the user based on the user's device. Examples:
`<img src="small-500.jpg" srcset="medium-700.jpg 700w, large-900.jpg 900w" alt="This Image Here">`
Here, in the `srcset` we write the image name, a space, then the actual width of the image using `w` instead of `px` to denote the actual width of the image. 
`<img src="images/normal.jpg" srcset="images/retina.jpg 2x" alt="This Image Here">`
Here, `2x` means retina display. A normal display is `1x`. In instances of retina displays viewing the website, the retina image would be swapped in.
