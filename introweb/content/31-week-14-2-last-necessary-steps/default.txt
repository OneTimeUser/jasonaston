Now that we have covered how to build, style, and program some behavior, all you need to know are the finishing touches on getting the website up and running. 


**Domain Names**
The domain name is the web address that you choose as the name of your site. 

**Hosting**
So that other people can see your site through your domain name, it has to be uploaded to a web server and hosted. Some characteristics of the hosting service are;
1.The Disk Space refers to how much space your site takes up (html, css, images, etc.)
2. Bandwidth represents the amount of data the hosting company will send to visitors. SO for instance if your site is a total of 5mb in size and 10 people view all pages of your website then you have used 50mb of bandwidth (usually, depending on the plan, you have in order of GB of bandwidth allotted to you).
3.Site Backups to preserve the site in case of and issue
4. Email Accounts
5. Server Side Languages and Databases- usually if you are using a CMS like Wordpress with use of a database

Some hosting services: GoDaddy, BlueHost, A Small Orange, Dreamhost

**Hosted Service**
Wordpress.com, Shopify, squarespace, and Tumblr provide the hosting. You can still POINT your domain to the hosted site so that your chosen domain looks like what is being hosted elsewhere 

**SEO**
SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization and is a huge topic. With the increased internet traffic and use of search engines to get at the info we want to see, it has become increasingly important to ensure that our website ranks as high as possible in search results. This is because it has been shown that most people don't click past the first page of search results. 

At the heart of it is working out which terms people are likely to enter in a search engine on a topic and then using these terms int he right places on your site to increase the likelihood that it will show up high on the query results list. 

But search engines also look at how many sites link to a site to determine its relevance and importance.

Pay attention to keywords in these areas of your site:
1.Page Title
2.URL/Web address
3.Headings
4.General Text
5.Link Text
6.Alt Text
7.Page Descriptions in meta tag

**Analytics**
Most people use google analytics as their source. Can sign up google.com/analytics in which you are given a piece of code to place on all pages you want to track.

In turn, as people visit, you have access to multitudes of information on behavior that can help you gauge how effective your site is.  Aside from gathering information on the visitor like where they are from and what device they were using, you will also have information such as:
1.How long they stuck around
2.Which pages are the most popular
3.Which pages people leave your site from
