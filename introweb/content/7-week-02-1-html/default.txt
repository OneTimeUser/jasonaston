**Lecture**

Today we covered HTML structure and semantic elements and text from the book. Like I said in class, most of the elements learned here are primarily for those who use text or wiki heavy workflows. Those of you who will stick around in academia may benefit from keeping an eye on these elements from Chapters 1 and 2.  

We also ventured in image element territory. More to come on that. 

We made a really cool website you can see here: http://cims.nyu.edu/~aston/week3.html
To peep the code, if in Chrome, head to View->Developer->View Source OR Developer Tools.  

We had issues with the <img> element due to the following screen capture:

Make sure, if you are going use TextEdit, to uncheck this and restart TextEdit.  TextEdit by default applies "smart quotes" or "decorative quotes" which are different from the single and double quotation marks we use in programming.  Sorry I didn't catch that. Then again I don't program in TextEdit ever.   

Also, remember if you are using an FTP client like Fetch or Cyberduck, you still might have to change permissions on the files you upload. 

For example in Cyberduck, if you press 'cmd-i' it will 'get info' on the highlighted file or folder. From there you can select 'Permissions' to ensure that Group and Other have Read privileges.
