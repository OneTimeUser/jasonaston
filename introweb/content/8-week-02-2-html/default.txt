**Lecture**

Today we addressed the `a` element and it's possible actions and references (`href`).
It can
-link to another page (via absolute or relative url's)
-link to another section of the same page or another page (using `#*idname*` so long as the section contains an addressable `id` attribute)
-email (`emailto:email@email.com` link)
-open a new window (`target="_blank"` attribute) or a new tab - depending on browser settings.

We also learned how to traverse a directory in and out.
